# foundrShiny

## Shiny app.R organization

This package has Shiny app routines organized in a modular fashion. The
main deployment
[app.R](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/app.R)
(located in the `inst/shinyApp` folder) is very short, calling `foundr`
package routines
[ui()](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/ui.R)
and
[server()](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/server.R).
The `server()` in turn calls the following
[moduleServer](https://shiny.posit.co/r/reference/shiny/1.7.0/moduleserver)
modules, which correspond to the tab panels:

- [shinyTraitPanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTraitPanel.R)
- [shinyContrastPanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyContrastPanel.R)
- [shinyTimePanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTimePanel.R)
- [shinyStatsPanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyStats.R)

Each of these in turn call additional modules. See the following for
more information on Shiny modules:

- [Modularizing Shiny app
  code](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/modules/)
- [Mastering Shiny
  reactivity](https://mastering-shiny.org/reactivity-intro.html)

Most `foundr` modules have their own “unit test” applets, located in the
`inst/shinyApp` folder. It turns out that having `app.R` in the folder
`inst/shinyApp` enables one to run other apps in that same folder. Hence
it is possible to unit test parts of the Shiny app. \[There may be other
Shiny tools to debug, but this is quite handy.\] For instance, the panel
applets are:

- [appTraitPanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/appTraitPanel.R)
- [appContrastPanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/appContrastPanel.R)
- [appTimePanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/appTimePanel.R)
- [appStatsPanel](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/appStats.R)

## Tasks to Do

- Update `TraitPanel` and `TimePanel` to use raw and normed data
  - Re-harmonize `TraitData` to raw data
- Selections on `ContrastPlot` plots
- Modules for volcano, biplot, dotplot to simplify code
  - Renaming?

## Modules called by panel modules

Each of the panel modules calls further modules as follows (with links
on first mention)

    - [shinyTimeTraits](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTimeTraits.R)
  - [shinyTimePlot](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyTimePlot.R)
    - `shinyDownloads`
- `ContrastPanel`
  - [shinyContrastTable](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyContrastTable.R)
    - `shinyTraitOrder`
  - [shinyContrastSex](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyContrastSex.R)
    - `shinyContrastPlot`
      - `shinyDownloads`
  - `shinyContrastTable` (for contrasts over time)
  - [shinyContrastTime](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyContrastTime.R)
    - `shinyTimeTraits`
  - `shinyTimePlot`
    - `shinyDownloads`
  - [shinyContrastModule](https://github.com/AttieLab-Systems-Genetics/foundr/blob/main/R/shinyContrastModule.R)
    - `shinyContrastPlot`
      - `shinyDownloads`

Notice that modules enable code reuse and reduction of code duplication.
The `TraitNames` module is reused for the key trait and related trait
names in the `Trait` panel. Download mechanics for all panels are
handled by the `shinyDownloads` module. The `shinyContrastPlot` module
used by the `Stats` panel for plots and tables is reused twice in the
`Contrast` panel, for the `ContrastSex` and `ContrastModule` sub-panels.
The `shinyTimePlot` and `shinyTimeTraits` modules used by the `Time`
panel are reused for the `ContrastTime` sub-panel of the `Contrast`
panel. The `shinyContrastTable` is used twice in the `Contrast` panel
for traits on their own and traits measured over time.

It is important to note that `module` is used here in two ways–for Shiny
modules via
[`moduleServer()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/moduleServer.html) and
for dimension-reduction “modules” constructed of traits via
[WGCNA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=WGCNA). The `ContrastModule`
Shiny module handles both WGCNA module eigentraits (`eigens()`) and
traits within a WGCNA module (`traits()`); this is done currently with
`if` logic, but might be modularized further later.

Another place where modularization could be leveraged is in the
`ContrastPlot` module, which uses `if` and `switch` logic for various
types of plots (`volcano`, `biplot`, `dotplot`, and maybe more). This
begs some module redesign in the future.

## Input parameters

The Shiny app includes multiple input parameters, which change other
features of the app. Some of these are at the level of the `ui()`,
possibly through `server()`-side reactives. Others are within panel
modules or buried deeper. The design is meant to have parameters at the
appropriate level, near the visualizations that they adjust.

### Server-level input parameters

- `main_par$dataset` dataset(s) examined
- `main_par$strains` strain(s) included for plots
- `main_par$height` height of plots
- `main_par$facet` facet on strains if `TRUE`
- `main_par$tabpanel` current active tab panel

These input parameters are referred to as `input$xxx` in the `server()`
module, but are passed as a set to other modules as `main_par$xxx`.

### Panel-level input parameters

Input parameters in the panel and other modules are local to each
module, but in some cases are passed on to subsequent modules. the
[`moduleServer()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/moduleServer.html)
technology requires that their input selection us a namespace through
the `ns()` device. See [Modularizing Shiny app
code](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/modules/) for details.

Persistence of values and cross-reference is tricky. It helps to use
[`reactiveVal()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/reactiveVal.html) but
need care.

- `TraitPanel`
  - `TraitOrderInput` dataset(s) and order
  - `TraitNamesUI` key trait
  - `reldataset` dataset(s)
  - `TrainnamesUI` related traits
  - `CorTableUI`
  - `mincor` minimum correlation
- `StatsPanel`
  - `ContrastPlotInput`
  - `ContrastPlotUI`
- `TimePanel`
  - `TimeTableInput`
- `ContrastPanel`
  - `TraitOrderInput` via `ContrastTable` for dataset(s) and order
  - `ContrastTableInput` for `Sex`, `Module` and `Time` sub-panels
  - `ContratsTimeInput` for `Time` sub-panel

#### dataset parameter

For `main_par$dataset`, I am finding the following behavior so far:

- `TraitPanel`
  - `dataset` set in `TraitOrderInput`
  - change `dataset` does not change in Contrast or Stats panels
  - change persists when switching back
- `StatsPanel`
  - `main_par$dataset` with local
    [`reactiveVal()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/reactiveVal.html)
  - change `dataset` does not change in Trait or Contrast panels
  - change does not persist when going to Trait or Contrast and back
- `TimesPanel`
  - `main_par$dataset` with local
    [`reactiveVal()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/shiny/man/reactiveVal.html)
  - uses its own system similar to Contrast/Time
- `ContrastPanel`
  - `dataset` set in `TraitOrderInput` via `ContrastTable`
  - change `dataset` does not change in Trait or Stats panels
  - change in Sex subpanel persists for Module subpanel and vice versa
  - Time subpanel is handled on its own (for now)
  - change does not persist when going to Trait or Stats and back

More information:

- The `server()` sets `input$dataset`, which is passed to all panels,
  but not necessarily used by them (yet).
- `TraitPanel` uses `input$keydataset` from within `TraitOrder`. That
  module uses `reactiveVal` to ensure persistence, but it is not
  available per se outside.
- `ContrastPanel` calls `ContrastTable`, which calls `TraitOrder`.
- `StatsPanel` uses `input$dataset` from `server()`.
- `TimePanel` uses its own system.

It might be possible to move the `TraitOrder` version up to using the
`server`. However, need to be careful about logic.
