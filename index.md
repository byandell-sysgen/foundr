# foundr: Multiparent Founder Study Tools

This package can be used on its own for analysis and visualization of
founder data, and is part of a (planned) collection of packages. See
[Foundr App Developer
Guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/171HEopFlSTtf_AbrA28YIAJxJHvkzihB4_lcV6Ct-eI)
for an overview of package(s) use and components.

- [foundr](https://github.com/byandell/foundr): data analysis and
  visualization
- [foundrShiny](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny): interactive
  shiny app
- foundrHarmony: harmonize data from multiple sources (to be written)
- [modulr](https://github.com/byandell/modulr): harmonize WGCNA module
  objects

There is a default app
([inst/shinyApp/app.R](https://github.com/byandell/foundr/blob/main/inst/shinyApp/app.R))
and shiny code in the [foundr](https://github.com/byandell/foundr)
package, which will be removed soon. See
[foundrShiny](https://github.com/byandell/foundrShiny) for the revised
shiny code. See the [foundrBase tree of
foundr](https://github.com/byandell/foundr/tree/foundrBase) for the
revised `foundr` package (in testing phase).

The foundrHarmony repo is currently in two places. The
[foundr](https://github.com/byandell/foundr) package has generic
functions for harmonizing data. The
[FounderDietStudy](https://github.com/byandell/FounderDietStudy)
repository has code for harmonizing specific datasets. This needs to be
organized better. See

- [DataHarmony.Rmd](https://github.com/byandell/FounderDietStudy/blob/main/DataHarmony.Rmd)
- [WGCNA.Rmd](https://github.com/byandell/FounderDietStudy/blob/main/WGCNA.Rmd)
- [WGCNAmixed_Data.Rmd](https://github.com/byandell/FounderDietStudy/blob/main/WGCNAmixed_Data.Rmd)

Specialized instances are being developed for particular studies. See
